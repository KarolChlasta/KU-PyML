The brief\n<p>Imagine working for a digital marketing agency, and the agency is approached by a massive online retailer of furniture. They want to test our skills at creating large campaigns for all of their website. We are tasked with creating a prototype set of keywords for search campaigns for their sofas section. The client says that they want us to generate keywords for the following products: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>sofas</li>\n<li>convertible sofas</li>\n<li>love seats</li>\n<li>recliners</li>\n<li>sofa beds</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>The brief</strong>: The client is generally a low-cost retailer, offering many promotions and discounts. We will need to focus on such keywords. We will also need to move away from luxury keywords and topics, as we are targeting price-sensitive customers. Because we are going to be tight on budget, it would be good to focus on a tightly targeted set of keywords and make sure they are all set to exact and phrase match.</p>\n<p>Based on the brief above we will first need to generate a list of words, that together with the products given above would make for good keywords. Here are some examples:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Products: sofas, recliners</li>\n<li>Words: buy, prices</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The resulting keywords: 'buy sofas', 'sofas buy', 'buy recliners', 'recliners buy',\n          'prices sofas', 'sofas prices', 'prices recliners', 'recliners prices'.</p>\n<p>As a final result, we want to have a DataFrame that looks like this: </p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Campaign</th>\n<th>Ad Group</th>\n<th>Keyword</th>\n<th>Criterion Type</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Campaign1</td>\n<td>AdGroup_1</td>\n<td>keyword 1a</td>\n<td>Exact</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Campaign1</td>\n<td>AdGroup_1</td>\n<td>keyword 1a</td>\n<td>Phrase</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Campaign1</td>\n<td>AdGroup_1</td>\n<td>keyword 1b</td>\n<td>Exact</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Campaign1</td>\n<td>AdGroup_1</td>\n<td>keyword 1b</td>\n<td>Phrase</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Campaign1</td>\n<td>AdGroup_2</td>\n<td>keyword 2a</td>\n<td>Exact</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Campaign1</td>\n<td>AdGroup_2</td>\n<td>keyword 2a</td>\n<td>Phrase</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>The first step is to come up with a list of words that users might use to express their desire in buying low-cost sofas.</p>"},{"execution_count":0,"metadata":{"dc":{"key":"4"},"collapsed":true,"tags":["sample_code"],"trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","outputs":[],"source":"# List of words to pair with products\nwords = ...\n\n# Print list of words\n# ...

Save and summarize!\n<p>To upload our campaign, we need to save it as a CSV file. Then we will be able to import it to AdWords editor or BingAds editor. There is also the option of pasting the data into the editor if we want, but having easy access to the saved data is great so let's save to a CSV file!</p>\n<p>Looking at a summary of our campaign structure is good now that we've wrapped up our keyword work. We can do that by grouping by ad group and criterion type and counting by keyword. This summary shows us that we assigned specific keywords to specific ad groups, which are each part of a campaign. In essence, we are telling Google (or Bing, etc.) that we want any of the words in each ad group to trigger one of the ads in the same ad group. Separately, we will have to create another table for ads, which is a task for another day and would look something like this:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Campaign</th>\n<th>Ad Group</th>\n<th>Headline 1</th>\n<th>Headline 2</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n<th>Final URL</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>SEM_Sofas</td>\n<td>Sofas</td>\n<td>Looking for Quality Sofas?</td>\n<td>Explore Our Massive Collection</td>\n<td>30-day Returns With Free Delivery Within the US.
